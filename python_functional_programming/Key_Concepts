First Class functions

Functions are treated as objects and functions can take other functions as arguments
Functions can be returned by functions.

What are closures?

 in simple terms: A closure is an inner function that remembers and has access to variables in the
 local scope in which it was created even after the outer function has finished executing.

 Why use closures at all?

 What are decorators?

 What are generators?

Currying in FP?

Decorators vs Closures?
Iterators vs Generators?
Where you use Closures against decorators and vice-versa.

Iteration vs recursion
Performance of recursion over iteration.

Idempotent:
# typical idempotent methods - http methods - GET, PUT, DELETE
## POST is not an idempotent method.

Mutability. How do you enforce mutability in python?
String are immutable.
Lists are mutable objects.
Keep in mind that operations like concatenating a string in a loop can create a lot of objects in memory.

Learning goals:

Lambdas
List, Set, Dictionary comprehension.

Modules: Logging, itertools
pure functions
First class functions
functions with side effects
immutable variables
