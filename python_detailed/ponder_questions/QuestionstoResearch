Why is recursion not python's strong feature? What is the inherent recursion limit in python?

Q - Why from collections import deque is much faster and elegant than doing direct operations such as delete and append and insert on a list?
A -
Adding or popping items from either end of a queue has O(1) complexity.
This is unlike a list where inserting or removing items from the front of the list is O(N).

Q- What is a PGP key? Why do devops engineers request you to provide it?

Q -  Lists vs Sets?
A -
The choice of whether or not to use lists or sets depends on intended use.
Use a list if you want to preserve the insertion order of the items.
Use a set if you want to eliminate duplicates (and don’t care about the order).
Sets are faster than lists.

Q - Ordere3dDict vs Dicts?
A -
Be aware that the size of an OrderedDict is more than twice as large as a normal dictionary due to the
extra linked list that’s created.
Thus, if you are going to build a data structure involving a large number of OrderedDict instances
(e.g., reading 100,000 lines of a CSV file into a list of OrderedDict instances),
you would need to study the re‐ quirements of your application to determine if the benefits of using an
OrderedDict outweighed the extra memory overhead.
