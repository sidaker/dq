Each entity or row here is known as a sample (or data point) in machine learning,
 while the columns—the properties that describe these entities—are called features.

 Building a good representation of your data, which is called feature extraction or feature engineering.

NumPy
NumPy is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python.
It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions
such as linear algebra operations and the Fourier transform, and pseudorandom number
generators.

SciPy is a collection of functions for scientific computing in Python.
It provides, among other functionality, advanced linear algebra routines,
mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions,
 and statistical distributions. scikit-learn draws from SciPy’s collection of functions
 for implementing its algorithms
