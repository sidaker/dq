Federated Access:

Data lake - > Raw data.
DWH -  Structured data made efficient for querying.

Big Query - Serverless DWH

Both Big Query and Athena are serverless.
Athena however is mainly a serverless query service with PResto being the SQL engine.
Big Query has a storage service as well as a query service.
Both support federated querying.
However Big Query is most performant if data is stored with in Big Query Storage

Query limits ?
Concurrent Queries
Access Control

Big Query usage by AI/ML pipelines

Big Query scales to PB
Optimized for Reads.
Column based storage.

Loading data from Cloud Storage to Big Query may be better in some cases as it
offers better network and hence throughput.

You can also query data in GCS from Big Query.

if you require really high throughput inserts, like more than a million rows per second or
ultra low latency on the order of milliseconds, consider Cloud Bigtable.

Cloud Data Proc (Spark jobs)
Cloud Data Flow (Apache Beam???)
teo typical services used to load Big Query.
