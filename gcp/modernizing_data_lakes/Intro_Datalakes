Data Sources
Data Sinks -> Where you data is eventually going to end. Commonly DWH.
Data Lakes -> DWH

Data Pipelines (Batch and Streaming)
Data Work Flows


Cloud Data Flow
Cloud composer - apache Air Flow
Cloud storage

Options for a Data lake on GCP
1. Cloud storage
2. Big Query can be an option. But in general it is a DWH.

Storage Options:
------------------------------

Cloud Storage (S3 like)
Cloud Spanner (For Relational Data)
Cloud SQL (For Relational Data)
Cloud big Table(For No SQL data)
Cloud firestore(For No SQL data)

EL
ELT
ETL

Federated Queries

Cloud Storage -> Object store.
moderate latency
High throughput

Storage Classes ->
standard storage
regional
Nearline
Coldline

Retention policy
Versioning
Life cycle management
------------------

Cloud SQL (RDS)
Migrate Postgres, MySQL , SQL Server to  Cloud SQL.

30 TB Capacity
60,000 IOPS
Optimized for writes (transactions)
Record based storage.

-------------

Big Query scales to PB
Optimized for Reads.
Column based storage.

Stack driver: Used for monitoring.

Cloud Data Catalog:

Data loss prevention (API):
ML job that scans your data for senstive data.

===============


Cloud Composer(managed Apache air Flow):
Orchestration of data pipelines.


=======

Securing access to buckets:
IAM -> Control Access at bucket level. Project roles, Bucket roles.
ACL -> Fine grained access at bucket or object level


Encryption:
Google Managed encryption keys. GMEK
  KEK - Key EK
  DEK - Data EK

Customer managed EK CMEK.

CSEK - Customer Supplied EK.

Client side encryption


=================

with Cloud SQL Google does
backups
update minor versions.
security updates

Cloud SQL's customer data is encrypted when on Google's internal networks, and
when stored in database tables temporary files in those backups that we
mentioned earlier. Every Cloud SQL instance includes a network firewall
allowing you to control network access to your database instance by
granting or revoking access.

Horizontally, you can quickly scale out read replicas, Google Cloud SQL supports 3 read replica scenarios.

For the special case of failover, Cloud SQL does support this, Cloud SQL instances
can be configured with a failover replica in a different zone within the same
 region. Then, Cloud SQL data is replicated across zones within a region for
 durability.
