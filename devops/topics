Creating an EC2 instance from cli

AMI's are region specific.
Make sure you attach using the key name you have created so you can ssh into the instance from your local machine.
You also need to add a security group allowing inbound traffic on port 22 from outside world.
You can get the list of AMI's available for the region from commandline.

aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0dacb0c129b49f529 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name SidevopsEC2KeyPair

2. AZ where the instance is running.
3. Create a Volume and get the volume id.
4. Attach Volume to the instance.
